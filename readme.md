<p>THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED: </p>
<p>The people i was making this for no longer want it but it was a good test of my pyhon abilities which defeneitly need work.</p>

<h1>v0.1</h1>

<p>Basic proof of consept. It opens the youtube trending page and scrolls through that in a somewhat human like way whilst a video plays in the corner.
Uses obs for video recording as making my own recording thing would take a long time, A long time i dont have.</p>

If All goes well next steps are probably:

<ul>
  <li>be able to look through urls in a csv and film a video scrolling through the home page.</li>
  <li>start scrolling through more than just a websites home page</li>
  <li>some way to easily change the settings of the obs websockets instead of having them hard written</li>
</ul>


<p> As a side note: The OBS intergration is acctually a really good idea in my eyes. OBS is free and the code justs selects a scene and starts recording.
  you can really customise anything that obs lets you and the code will not give two shits if you recording the website scrolling or not.</p>
