v0.1

Basic proof of consept. It opens the youtube trending page and scrolls through that in a somewhat human like way whilst a video plays in the corner.
Uses obs for video recording as coding my own methord would take a long ass time, A long as time i dont have. The OBS intergration is acctually a really
good idea in my eyes. OBS is free and the app litteraly justs selects a scene and starts recording you you can really customise anything that obs lets you and the app will not give two shits.

If All goes well next steps are probably:

-be able to look through urls in a csv and film a video scrolling through the home page. 
-start scrolling through more than just a websites home page
-some way to easily change the settings of the obs websockets instead of having them hard written
-find a way to scrape links and bring them into a csv.
