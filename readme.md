<h1>v0.1</h1>

<p>Basic proof of consept. It opens the youtube trending page and scrolls through that in a somewhat human like way whilst a video plays in the corner.
Uses obs for video recording as coding my own methord would take a long ass time, A long as time i dont have.</p>

If All goes well next steps are probably:

<ul>
  <li>be able to look through urls in a csv and film a video scrolling through the home page.</li>
  <li>start scrolling through more than just a websites home page</li>
  <li>some way to easily change the settings of the obs websockets instead of having them hard written</li>
  <li>find a way to scrape links and bring them into a csv.</li>
</ul>


<p> As a side note: The OBS intergration is acctually a really good idea in my eyes. OBS is free and the code justs selects a scene and starts recording.
  you can really customise anything that obs lets you and the code will not give two shits if you recording the website scrolling or not.</p>
